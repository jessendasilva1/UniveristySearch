It provides an introduction to the issues of planning in the public realm and its role in implementation of the development of municipalities through both growth as well as decline. This is achieved by examining planning theory and reflecting on the context and process of planning in practice in Canada. The student in the course will come to understand both the role of theory in guiding practice as well as the role of practice in evolution of theory. This understanding is critical to the role of the professional planner in facilitating local development and managing change in the public interest.",

    "description": "Controlled Environment Systems (CES), otherwise known as Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA), is a rapidly evolving technological framework for producing crops in a stable, controlled and efficient manner. This CES/CEA technological platform is poised to play a significant role in current and emerging social and environmental issues including, but not limited to, climate change adaptation, food insecurity (urban and Northern/remote communities), local food supply, food supply chain stabilization, food safety, medicinal crop production and standardization, biodiversity preservation, functional foods/improved human nutrition, etc. Highly controlled production of plants in CES is even an absolute requirement in the global quest to explore and colonize the moon, Mars and beyond. This course will provide the student with a strong understanding of the principles of CES/CEA and will dig deep into the wide range of commercial, research, and human space exploration applications of CES/CEA. Through numerous guest speakers, students will also develop a sense of the career opportunities in this rapidly growing sector.",

Student activities are divided equally between observing, collecting and identifying specimens from more than 20 families and an experimental component involving one or more studies to test hypotheses about the ecology or behaviour of insects. There are occasional lectures and discussions to highlight particularly interesting observations of insects. Student evaluation is based on the student's insect collection and associated logbook, a written paper describing their experiment, contributions to class discussions and activities, and peer evaluation. The field site is generally in the USA or South America. Course fees cover costs of room, board, supplies, and transportation to the field site(s). This course must be recorded as part of the student's Fall or Winter course selection and tuition and compulsory fees will be calculated accordingly.

Students will critically engage in the simulation using the skills that they have acquired (such as communication, research methods, and legal research skills), and will apply their substantive and conceptual understanding of law, legal process, and justice to their broader area of emphasis. Students will critically reflect on such questions as how law and legal processes shape and are shaped by broader social and political power dynamics, the degree to which law is \"political\"; and how the framing of the issue and solutions during the simulation in terms of law and justice created strategies, goals, and outcomes that may be distinct from other social and political approaches to the issue.",

A departmental registration form must be obtained from the course coordinator and signed by the faculty advisor before students can be admitted into the course. This two-semester course is offered over any two consecutive semesters, with MGMT*4991 in the first semester and MGMT*4992 in the second semester. A grade will not be assigned in MGMT*4991 until MGMT*4992 has been completed.",

A key feature of the course is learning research designs and workflows that are consistent with disciplinary standards and likely to create replicable study results. Students will focus on the correspondence between complex designs and the statistical techniques that can be used to analyze the data resulting from such designs. In addition to readings, lectures, and in-class exercises, students will be guided through the process of creating scripts for analyzing quantitative data and reporting on an empirical investigation.",

The course is held at the Huntsman Marine Science Centre, St. Andrews, New Brunswick. The ecology, behaviour, physiology, biochemistry, biomechanics of marine plants and animals will be studied as well as basic oceanographic techniques. Students will be able to familiarize themselves with the techniques and equipment involved in various branches of marine biology and oceanography. In addition to regular tuition fees, students are responsible for the cost of transportation to St. Andrews, and for charges levied by the Huntsman Marine Science Centre for room and board. These fees are paid to Student Finance and Awards of the University of Guelph. A department application form must be submitted for approval before course selection. The signature of the course coordinator is required to select the course. This course must be recorded as part of your Fall course selection and tuition and compulsory fees will be calculated accordingly. Students taking this course DO NOT use course numbers reserved for Ontario Universities Program in Field Biology.",

The remainder of the course will be organized around specific contemporary problems in vertebrate biology such as the evolution of endothermy; feeding strategies and metabolism; locomotion and migration; trends in vertebrate reproduction; evolution of brain size and complexity in relation to cognition and communication. Each problem will be explored through analyses of taxonomic diversity, historical and phylogenetic constraints, physiological and developmental causes, and functional effects.",
